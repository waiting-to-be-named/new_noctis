# DICOM Viewer Issues and Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified from Server Logs

### 1. **Undefined Variables in Upload Function** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: `pixel_spacing_x` and `pixel_spacing_y` were used without being defined, causing 400 errors
- **Fix**: Added proper variable initialization before use in the upload function

### 2. **Cross-Platform File Path Issues** ✅ FIXED
- **Issue**: Database contains Windows absolute paths (e.g., `E:\new_noctis-main...`) but server is running on Linux
- **Symptoms**: "Trying to read DICOM from file path: E:\..." messages in logs
- **Fix**: 
  - Updated `load_dicom_data()` method to handle Windows paths and convert them
  - Created management command `fix_file_paths` to batch fix existing paths
  - Added automatic path correction on file access

### 3. **CSRF Token Issues with Login**
- **Issue**: Double form submission causing CSRF token mismatch
- **Symptoms**: 
  - First login succeeds (302)
  - Immediate second POST fails with "CSRF token from POST incorrect"
- **Possible Causes**:
  - JavaScript submitting form twice
  - Browser following redirect and resubmitting
  - Custom CSRF middleware interfering

### 4. **Duplicate File Upload Prevention**
- **Issue**: Second upload of same files returns 400 error
- **Cause**: `get_or_create` properly preventing duplicates but error message is unclear

## Applied Fixes

### 1. Fixed Upload Function Variables
```python
# Added before image creation:
pixel_spacing_x = None
pixel_spacing_y = None
if hasattr(dicom_data, 'PixelSpacing'):
    try:
        pixel_spacing = dicom_data.PixelSpacing
        if isinstance(pixel_spacing, (list, tuple)) and len(pixel_spacing) >= 2:
            pixel_spacing_x = float(pixel_spacing[0])
            pixel_spacing_y = float(pixel_spacing[1])
    except:
        pass
```

### 2. Enhanced load_dicom_data() Method
- Automatically detects and converts Windows paths
- Updates database with corrected paths
- Multiple fallback strategies to find files

### 3. Created Management Command
```bash
python manage.py fix_file_paths
```
This command will:
- Scan all DicomImage records
- Fix Windows paths to Linux-compatible paths
- Update database with corrected paths

## Recommendations

### To Fix Remaining Issues:

1. **Run the file path fix command**:
   ```bash
   python manage.py fix_file_paths
   ```

2. **For CSRF issues**, check:
   - JavaScript in login form for duplicate submissions
   - Browser console for any errors
   - Consider simplifying the custom CSRF middleware

3. **For better error messages**:
   - Update upload endpoint to provide clearer messages for duplicate files
   - Add proper error handling for various upload scenarios

### Testing the Fixes:

1. Clear browser cache and cookies
2. Try uploading new DICOM files
3. Check if existing studies can be viewed
4. Monitor logs for any remaining path issues

The main issue causing the viewer not to work was the file path incompatibility between Windows and Linux. The fixes applied should resolve this and allow proper DICOM file access.
