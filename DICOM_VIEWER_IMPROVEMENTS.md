- Enhanced image loading with loading indicators
- Better error handling throughout the application
- Improved study and patient information loading
- Loading state management

### Styling Updates (`static/css/dicom_viewer.css`)
- Comprehensive notification styles with animations
- Enhanced patient information display
- Improved clinical information panel styling
- Modern button and UI component designs
- Better responsive design considerations

### Template Improvements (`templates/dicom_viewer/viewer.html`)

- Better semantic HTML structure

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Image Loading**: Users now see clear loading indicators and meaningful error messages when images fail to load
2. **Patient Information**: Clinical information is now prominently displayed with a professional, collapsible interface
3. **Notifications**: All system feedback is now handled through attractive, non-intrusive notifications
4. **Visual Design**: The interface now has a modern, professional appearance with smooth animations
5. **Error Recovery**: Better error handling means the application continues to function even when individual components fail

## Browser Compatibility
All improvements use modern web standards while maintaining compatibility with current browsers. CSS animations and JavaScript features are gracefully handled.

## Future Enhancements
The improved architecture provides a solid foundation for future enhancements such as:
- Real-time study updates
- Advanced image processing features
- Enhanced clinical workflow integration
- Additional notification types and configurations

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with various DICOM file formats and sizes
2. Verify notification behavior across different screen sizes
3. Test patient information display with varying data completeness
4. Validate image loading with network connectivity issues
5. Test clinical information panel interactions

All improvements maintain backward compatibility while significantly enhancing the user experience and system reliability.
