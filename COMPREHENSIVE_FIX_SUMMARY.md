## 🔧 Key Fixes Applied

### 1. Upload System Fixes
```python
# Enhanced upload endpoint with comprehensive error handling
@csrf_exempt
@require_http_methods(['POST'])
def upload_dicom_files(request):
    # Added multiple DICOM file detection methods
    # Enhanced file validation and error handling
    # Improved response formatting for frontend compatibility
```

### 2. Image Processing Fixes
```python
# Robust image data retrieval with fallback mechanisms
@api_view(['GET'])
def get_image_data(request, image_id):
    # Enhanced diagnostic-quality processing
    # Multiple fallback methods for missing files
    # Improved error handling and response formatting
```

### 3. Frontend JavaScript Fixes
```javascript
// Comprehensive upload functionality
setupUploadHandlers() {
    // File input change handlers
    // Drag and drop support
    // Progress indicators
    // Error handling and user feedback
}

async startUpload() {
    // FormData creation
    // CSRF token handling
    // Progress tracking
    // Success/error feedback
}
```

### 4. URL Configuration Fixes
```python
# Corrected endpoint patterns for JavaScript compatibility
path('api/images/<int:image_id>/data/', views.get_image_data, name='get_image_data'),
path('api/upload/', views.upload_dicom_files, name='upload_dicom'),
```

### 5. Settings Configuration Fixes
```python
# Added testserver to ALLOWED_HOSTS for testing
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['localhost', '127.0.0.1', 'testserver']
```
