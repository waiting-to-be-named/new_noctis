# DICOM Viewer and Worklist Status Fixes

This document outlines all the fixes implemented to address the issues with the DICOM viewer and worklist status management.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Middleware Updates
- Replaced the middleware.py file with the provided enhanced version that includes:
  - Proper CSRF handling for file uploads
  - JSON error responses for API endpoints
  - CORS support for cross-origin requests
  - Security headers for better protection
  - Request logging and performance monitoring

### 2. Worklist Status Management

#### Initial Status Setting
- Updated `upload_dicom_files` function in `viewer/views.py` (line 451):
  - Changed initial status from 'completed' to 'scheduled' when creating WorklistEntry
- Updated `upload_dicom_folder` function in `viewer/views.py` (line 788):
  - Changed initial status from 'completed' to 'scheduled' when creating WorklistEntry

#### Status Progression
- When radiologist clicks "View" button in worklist:
  - Status automatically changes from 'scheduled' to 'in_progress'
  - This is handled in `DicomViewerView.get_context_data()` (lines 110-118)
- When radiologist saves report:
  - Status changes from 'in_progress' to 'completed'
  - This is handled in `create_report` function (lines 186-189)

### 3. Print Button Access
- Modified `worklist.html` template (lines 128-141):
  - Moved print button outside the radiologist/admin check
  - Now all users can see and use the print button if a report exists

### 4. DICOM Viewer UI Improvements

#### Navigation Bar Updates
- Changed "Select DICOM from System" to "Select Study" for better clarity
- This change was made in `viewer.html` (line 127)

#### Layout Fixes
- Updated `dicom_viewer.css` to fix layout issues:
  - Added proper viewport constraints to prevent overflow
  - Fixed top-bar height with min/max height settings
  - Added responsive sizing for better screen adaptation

#### File Path Handling
- Enhanced `load_dicom_data` method in `DicomImage` model:
  - Added more alternative path checking
  - Better error messages for debugging
  - Support for different Django deployment scenarios

## How the Status Flow Works

1. **Upload**: When DICOM files are uploaded, a WorklistEntry is created with status='scheduled'
2. **View**: When a radiologist clicks the "View" button to open the viewer, the status changes to 'in_progress'
3. **Report**: When the radiologist completes and saves the report, the status changes to 'completed'

## UI/UX Improvements

1. **Viewer Resolution**: Added proper viewport constraints to ensure the viewer fits the screen properly
2. **Navigation**: Simplified the study selection dropdown text
3. **Print Access**: Made print functionality available to all users who need it
4. **Status Visibility**: Clear status badges in the worklist show the current state of each study

## Error Handling

The new middleware provides better error handling for:
- File upload failures
- API endpoint errors  
- CSRF token issues
- Missing DICOM files
- Image processing errors

## Testing

To verify these changes:
1. Upload DICOM files and check that worklist shows "Scheduled" status
2. Click "View" and verify status changes to "In Progress"
3. Save a report and verify status changes to "Completed"
4. Check that all users can see the print button when a report exists
5. Verify the viewer layout is properly constrained to the screen
6. Confirm patient information displays correctly in the viewer

## Known Issues Resolved

- ✅ Status not updating correctly in worklist
- ✅ Print button only visible to radiologists
- ✅ Viewer extending beyond screen bounds
- ✅ "Select from System" text unclear
- ✅ Patient info not displaying in viewer
- ✅ Image loading errors due to file path issues
