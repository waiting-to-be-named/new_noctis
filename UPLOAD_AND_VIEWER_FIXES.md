# Noctis DICOM System - Upload and Viewer Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Worklist Not Showing Uploaded Files

**Problem**: Uploaded files were successfully processed and stored as studies, but worklist entries were not being created consistently.

**Root Cause**: 
- Worklist entry creation was failing silently when no facilities existed
- Database constraint required a facility for worklist entries
- Error handling was insufficient

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Enhanced Worklist Entry Creation** (`viewer/views.py`):
   - Added automatic facility creation if none exists
   - Improved error handling with fallback options
   - Added detailed logging for debugging

2. **Database Model Update** (`viewer/models.py`):
   - Changed `WorklistEntry.facility` to allow null values
   - Created migration to update database schema

3. **Consistency Check Function** (`viewer/views.py`):
   - Added `ensure_worklist_entries()` function to fix missing entries
   - Created Django management command for easy execution

### 2. DICOM Viewer Server Errors

**Problem**: DICOM viewer was failing to load images, causing server errors.

**Root Cause**:
- Insufficient error handling in image processing
- Missing file existence checks
- Poor error messages for debugging

**Fixes Applied**:
1. **Enhanced Image Processing** (`viewer/models.py`):
   - Added file existence checks before processing
   - Improved error handling with detailed error messages
   - Added fallback window/level values
   - Better array type handling

2. **Improved API Endpoint** (`viewer/views.py`):
   - Enhanced `get_image_data()` with better error handling
   - Added detailed error responses for debugging
   - Improved parameter validation

## How to Apply the Fixes

### Step 1: Install Dependencies
```bash
# Create virtual environment (if not exists)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Install requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Apply Database Migrations
```bash
# Apply the new migration for worklist entries
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 3: Fix Existing Data
```bash
# Run the worklist fix command
python manage.py fix_worklist

# Or run the debug script to check current status
python test_upload_debug.py
```

### Step 4: Test the Fixes
```bash
# Run the test script to verify fixes work
python test_fixes.py
```

## Debugging Tools Created

### 1. Debug Script (`test_upload_debug.py`)
This script provides comprehensive diagnostics:
- Database status check
- Media file verification
- Worklist consistency analysis
- Image accessibility testing

### 2. Test Script (`test_fixes.py`)
This script verifies the fixes work correctly:
- Tests worklist entry creation
- Tests facility auto-creation
- Validates data consistency

### 3. Management Command (`fix_worklist`)
Django management command to fix missing worklist entries:
```bash
python manage.py fix_worklist
```

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Worklist Display
1. Upload DICOM files through the worklist interface
2. Verify files appear in the worklist immediately
3. Check that all uploaded studies have corresponding worklist entries

### 2. Test DICOM Viewer
1. Click "View" on a worklist entry
2. Verify images load without server errors
3. Test window/level adjustments
4. Verify measurements and annotations work

### 3. Monitor Logs
Check the Django logs for any remaining errors:
```bash
tail -f logs/django.log
```

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: "No module named 'django'"
**Solution**: Install dependencies in virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Issue: "Database table does not exist"
**Solution**: Run migrations
```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### Issue: "Permission denied" for file uploads
**Solution**: Check media directory permissions
```bash
chmod -R 755 media/
```

### Issue: DICOM files not loading in viewer
**Solution**: Check file paths and DICOM validity
```bash
python test_upload_debug.py
```

## Performance Improvements

1. **Caching**: Consider implementing image caching for better performance
2. **Async Processing**: Large uploads could benefit from async processing
3. **File Validation**: Add more robust DICOM file validation

## Security Considerations

1. **File Upload Limits**: Ensure proper file size limits are enforced
2. **Authentication**: Verify user permissions for upload/view operations
3. **File Sanitization**: Validate uploaded files thoroughly

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Regular Checks
1. Run `test_upload_debug.py` periodically to check system health
2. Monitor log files for errors
3. Check database consistency with `fix_worklist` command

### Backup Strategy
1. Regular database backups
2. Media file backups
3. Configuration backups

## Support

If issues persist after applying these fixes:

1. Run the debug script: `python test_upload_debug.py`
2. Check the logs: `tail -f logs/django.log`
3. Verify database state: `python manage.py shell`
4. Test with sample DICOM files

## Files Modified

- `viewer/views.py`: Enhanced upload and image processing
- `viewer/models.py`: Improved image processing and worklist model
- `viewer/migrations/0003_allow_null_facility.py`: Database migration
- `viewer/management/commands/fix_worklist.py`: Management command
- `test_upload_debug.py`: Debug script
- `test_fixes.py`: Test script

These fixes should resolve the upload and viewer issues you're experiencing. The enhanced error handling and automatic facility creation should prevent the worklist display problems, while the improved image processing should eliminate the DICOM viewer server errors.
