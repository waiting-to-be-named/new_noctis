# DICOM Upload and Viewing Fixes Summary

## Date: December 2024

### Issues Fixed

1. **Upload Error Messages**
   - Previously showed generic "error uploading" message
   - Now shows specific error messages based on error type:
     - File validation errors
     - File size limit errors (100MB)
     - Network connection errors
     - Server errors with details
     - Invalid DICOM format errors

2. **View Button in Worklist**
   - View button now correctly redirects to viewer with study ID
   - URL pattern: `/worklist/entry/{entry_id}/view/` → `/viewer/study/{study_id}/`
   - Viewer properly loads the study when accessed via this URL

3. **DICOM Viewer Loading**
   - Fixed duplicate function names (loadStudy vs loadStudyImages)
   - Consolidated to use `loadStudyImages` consistently
   - Fixed missing function calls (updateImageControls → updateSliders)
   - Initial study ID is properly passed from URL to JavaScript

### Files Modified

1. **`static/js/dicom_viewer.js`**
   - Enhanced error handling in `uploadFiles()` and `uploadFolder()` functions
   - Added specific error messages for different scenarios
   - Added visual feedback with color-coded progress bar
   - Added `showSuccess()` method for success notifications
   - Fixed function inconsistencies (loadStudy vs loadStudyImages)
   - Fixed undefined function calls

2. **`viewer/views.py`**
   - Already had proper implementation for handling study_id in URL
   - Sets `initial_study_id` in template context

3. **`templates/dicom_viewer/viewer.html`**
   - Already properly passes `initial_study_id` to JavaScript

4. **`worklist/views.py`**
   - Already had proper `view_study_from_worklist` function
   - Correctly redirects to viewer with study ID

### User Experience Improvements

1. **Clear Error Messages**
   - Users now see specific reasons why uploads fail
   - Helpful suggestions included (check file format, size, connection)
   - Error messages auto-dismiss after 5 seconds

2. **Visual Feedback**
   - Progress bar turns green on success
   - Progress bar turns red on error
   - Success notifications with green background
   - Error notifications with red background

3. **Seamless Navigation**
   - Click "View" in worklist → Opens viewer with study loaded
   - No need to manually select study after clicking View
   - Study information automatically displayed

### Testing Recommendations

1. **Upload Testing**
   - Try uploading valid DICOM files
   - Try uploading non-DICOM files to see error message
   - Try uploading files > 100MB to see size error
   - Disconnect network and try upload to see network error

2. **View Button Testing**
   - Go to Worklist page
   - Find entry with uploaded study
   - Click "View" button
   - Verify viewer opens with images displayed

3. **Error Handling Testing**
   - Test various error scenarios
   - Verify error messages are clear and helpful
   - Check that notifications appear and auto-dismiss

### Next Steps

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify DICOM files are valid using a DICOM validator
3. Check server logs for backend errors
4. Ensure media directories have write permissions
