# Fixes Implemented

## 1. Save Report Error Resolution

### Issue
There was an error while saving reports in the report creation page.

### Fix Applied
- Added comprehensive error handling in the `create_report` view (`/workspace/worklist/views.py`)
- Added support for both JSON and form data content types
- Added try-catch blocks with detailed error messages
- Improved JSON parsing error handling

### Changes Made
```python
# Added content type checking
if request.content_type == 'application/json':
    data = json.loads(request.body)
else:
    data = request.POST.dict()

# Added error handling for JSON parsing
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    return JsonResponse({'error': 'Invalid JSON data'}, status=400)
except Exception as e:
    return JsonResponse({'error': f'Error parsing data: {str(e)}'}, status=400)
```

## 2. Print Button Visibility

### Issue
The print button was only visible for finalized reports, restricting access.

### Fix Applied
- Modified the template condition in `/workspace/templates/worklist/report.html`
- Changed from checking both report existence AND finalized status to just checking report existence
- Now any saved report (draft or finalized) can be printed

### Changes Made
```html
<!-- Before -->
{% if report and report.status == 'finalized' %}

<!-- After -->
{% if report %}
```

## 3. DICOM SCP/SCU Server Implementation

### Features Implemented

#### A. Main DICOM Server (`/workspace/dicom_server.py`)
- Full DICOM SCP (Storage Class Provider) implementation
- Receives DICOM images from remote facilities
- Auto-generates AE titles from facility names
- Supports C-STORE and C-ECHO operations
- Automatic facility recognition based on AE title
- Creates new facilities for unknown AE titles
- Stores received images in organized directory structure
- Updates database with all DICOM metadata

#### B. Multi-Port Server (`/workspace/dicom_multiport_server.py`)
- Runs multiple DICOM servers simultaneously
- Each facility gets its own port (base port 11112 + facility ID)
- Thread-based implementation for concurrent servers
- Configuration listing feature

#### C. Django Management Command
- Created `/workspace/viewer/management/commands/run_dicom_server.py`
- Allows running server with: `python3 manage.py run_dicom_server`
- Supports --config flag to show facility configurations

#### D. Systemd Service
- Created `/workspace/noctis-dicom-server.service`
- Enables running DICOM server as a system service
- Automatic restart on failure
- Proper logging configuration

### AE Title Generation Algorithm
1. Convert facility name to uppercase
2. Remove all non-alphanumeric characters
3. Limit to 16 characters (DICOM standard)
4. If less than 4 characters, append MD5 hash suffix

### Example Configurations
```
Facility: Main Hospital
  AE Title: MAINHOSPITAL
  Port: 11113

Facility: City Clinic  
  AE Title: CITYCLINIC
  Port: 11114
```

## 4. Additional Improvements

### Requirements Updated
- Added `pynetdicom==2.0.2` for DICOM networking support
- Kept all existing dependencies including `reportlab` for PDF generation

### Documentation
- Created comprehensive DICOM server documentation in `/workspace/DICOM_SERVER_README.md`
- Includes setup instructions, configuration details, and troubleshooting guide

### Directory Structure
- Created `/workspace/dicom_storage/` for storing received DICOM files
- Organized as: `dicom_storage/<StudyUID>/<SeriesUID>/<InstanceUID>.dcm`

## Usage Instructions

### Running the DICOM Server

1. **Single facility mode:**
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py run_dicom_server
   ```

2. **Multi-facility mode:**
   ```bash
   python3 dicom_multiport_server.py
   ```

3. **View configurations:**
   ```bash
   python3 manage.py run_dicom_server --config
   ```

4. **As a service:**
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start noctis-dicom-server
   ```

### Configuring Remote PACS
1. Get facility configuration using --config flag
2. Add destination in PACS with:
   - AE Title: Auto-generated title
   - IP: Your server IP
   - Port: Assigned port for facility
3. Test with C-ECHO
4. Send images

## Testing the Fixes

### Test Report Saving
1. Navigate to a study report page
2. Enter report details
3. Click "Save Draft" - should save without errors
4. Click "Finalize Report" - should finalize successfully

### Test Print Button
1. Create a draft report
2. Print button should be visible immediately
3. Click print to generate PDF

### Test DICOM Server
1. Run server with --config to see facility settings
2. Configure remote PACS with the settings
3. Send test images
4. Verify images appear in worklist for correct facility
