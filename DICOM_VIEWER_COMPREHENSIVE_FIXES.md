# DICOM Viewer Comprehensive Fixes

## Overview
This document summarizes all the fixes implemented to resolve the issues with the DICOM viewer.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Worklist Button Not Working
**Problem**: The worklist button in the DICOM viewer was not functioning properly.

**Solution**: 
- Fixed event listener handling in `static/js/dicom_viewer.js`
- Improved event listener management to prevent duplicates
- Added proper error handling for the worklist navigation

**Files Modified**:
- `static/js/dicom_viewer.js` - Lines 270-280

### 2. Logout Button Not Working
**Problem**: The logout button was not functioning properly.

**Solution**: 
- Verified the onclick handler in the HTML template
- The button already had the correct implementation: `onclick="window.location.href='/accounts/logout/'"`
- No changes needed as the implementation was correct

**Files Checked**:
- `templates/dicom_viewer/viewer.html` - Line 468

### 3. Images Not Showing in Canvas
**Problem**: Images were not displaying properly in the DICOM viewer canvas.

**Solution**: 
- Enhanced the `render()` method in `static/js/dicom_viewer.js`
- Added proper image loading checks using `imgElement.complete` and `imgElement.naturalWidth`
- Added retry mechanism for images that haven't loaded yet
- Improved error handling and loading states

**Files Modified**:
- `static/js/dicom_viewer.js` - Lines 2839-2895

### 4. Series Selector Position
**Problem**: The series selector window was positioned poorly and hard to use.

**Solution**: 
- Repositioned the series selector to be centered on screen by default
- Added better positioning options (top, side, bottom)
- Improved styling with better borders, shadows, and backdrop blur
- Made the selector more user-friendly with proper sizing

**Files Modified**:
- `templates/dicom_viewer/viewer.html` - Lines 12-80

### 5. 3D Dropdown Positioning
**Problem**: The 3D button dropdown was positioned too far to the left, making text unreadable.

**Solution**: 
- Improved dropdown positioning in CSS
- Increased minimum width for dropdown menus
- Enhanced positioning logic for bottom toolbar items
- Added better responsive behavior

**Files Modified**:
- `static/css/dicom_viewer.css` - Lines 340-345

### 6. Enhanced Upload Button
**Problem**: The enhanced upload button was too complex and not user-friendly.

**Solution**: 
- Simplified the upload interface to "Load DICOM"
- Reverted to simple file/folder selection
- Removed complex progress tracking and bulk upload features
- Made the interface more intuitive with clear "Select Files" and "Select Folder" buttons
